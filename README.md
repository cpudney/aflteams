# AFL Team Players

Histograms of AFL player age, games played, height and weight grouped by team. Each histogram is marked by a red circle indicating the average value (age, games, height or weight) for the team. Mouseover the marker displays the value in a tooltip. The order in which the histograms are laid out can be sorted by this average value by pressing  the relevant button.
